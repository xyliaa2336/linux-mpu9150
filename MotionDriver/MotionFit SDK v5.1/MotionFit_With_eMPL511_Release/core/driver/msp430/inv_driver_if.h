 *      @details    For easy integration with eMPL, third-party accels and
 *                  compasses are expected to implement all the functions
 *                  declared here. Some assumptions are made about the
 *                  third-party device; if these assumptions are invalid, any
 *                  custom driver will work, but the HAL will need to be
 *                  modified accordingly.
